# Homework Sep 21

Twenty five years ago my grandparents lived in the village of Ergli in Latvia :) That was a reason I'm in Riga right now. I love indoor volleyball, but Latvia — a beautiful land of sand coast — is a country of beach volleyball.

There was European Championship this week. It had been located in Jurmala for a couple of weeks. My friends played there. I visited them one day. The weather was very good and the Baltic sea was warm. Under a bright sun I saw an entrance into the championship. Tickets were sold online only. Like a quote in that original grandparents story, «my granddad swam, but I didn't. Because i hadn't any internet with me»

On the next day the weather wasn't good. There was a huge storm in Riga and Jurmala. All the night I was listening for falling trees in the park. And the volleyboll championship arena looks like this at the moment:
