# Lesson 10 Feedback

I had completed my first written task before lesson. [a]
I got ~30 errors in ~100 rows. [b]
I translated a known story. [c]
Translation was easier than free writing. [d]
Grammar rules betray me while I am taking care about meaning. [e,f]
I still have a lot of work to do. [g]

My teacher is the greatest bonus. [h]
She takes care of me and I feel it. [i]
She got my respect and I trust her. [j]
Her voice is as pleasant as an angel's voice. [k]
And she is cute. I like her very much. [<3]

Thank you!
Please continue :)
